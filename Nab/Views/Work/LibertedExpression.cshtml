<p>A PHP based site implementing the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii MVC framework</a> via <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> as dependency manager.</p>
<p>The front-end features a fully responsive design. The design was arrived at in collaboration with the owner, having a requirement for an essentially old style semi-fixed 'kiosk' layout at maximum viewport widths.</p>
<p>Created in conjunction with a previous colleague, <a href="https://github.com/cieclarke">Chris Clarke</a>.</p>
